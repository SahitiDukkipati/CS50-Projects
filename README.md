# CS50 Projects
This repository includes my implementations from CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python.
Each file highlights the parts of logic or algorithms I wrote for different projects.
## Contents
- Knights — logical puzzle-solving using propositional logic
  Tools Used: Python, data structures (queues, sets), search algorithms
- Degrees — finding shortest connection paths between actors using graph search
   Tools Used: Python, propositional logic (from CS50’s logic library).
