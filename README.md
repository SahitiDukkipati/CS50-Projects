# CS50 AI Projects
This repository contains my implementations from **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**.
Each file includes the logic or algorithmic part I wrote for the projects.

## Included so far
* **Knights** – Propositional logic to identify truth-tellers and liars.
    Tools Used: Python, data structures (queues, sets), search algorithms.
* **Degrees** – Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two actors.
     Tools Used: Python, propositional logic (from CS50’s logic library).
